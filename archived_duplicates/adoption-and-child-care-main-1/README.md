## Restoring the Database

To restore the database using the provided SQL file, follow these steps:

1. Make sure MySQL is running on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the following command (replace 'root' and database name if needed):

```
mysql -u root adoption_and_childcare_tracking_system_db < database/adoption_and_childcare_tracking_system_db.sql
```

- This will recreate the tables and data as exported.
- You can also use tools like DBeaver or phpMyAdmin to import the SQL file if you prefer a graphical interface.
